<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I hold a degree in telecommunications engineering, 
  specializing in radiocommunication. 
  My career has allowed me to develop a variety
   of skills and acquire solid experience in the 
   field. During my two (02) month internship at the
    electricity company ADES, I participated in the
     maintenance and deployment of electrical networks, 
     allowing me to understand the interconnection between
      electrical systems and telecommunications infrastructures.

  Subsequently, I completed another nine (09) week internship at 
  CAMTEL, where I deepened my technical knowledge by working on 
  projects related to the optimization and maintenance of telecommunications networks. 
  This experience allowed me to better understand the challenges associated with managing
   large-scale networks and implementing effective technical solutions.

  In addition, I completed the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) training, during
   which I validated the CCNA 1 and 2 certifications. This training allowed me to master
    the basic and advanced concepts in networking, which strengthens my ability to intervene
     effectively on telecommunications infrastructures. Currently, I am retraining in my second 
     passion which is web development.
